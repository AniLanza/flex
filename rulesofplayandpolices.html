        youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, 
        team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from 
        this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey 
        background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</h3>

    <h2 class="subtitules">IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h2>
    <ol class="orden">
        <li class="number-1"><strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong> IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within 
            a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be 
            adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.</li>

            a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in 
            the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these 
            minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
            assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
            whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
            from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
            field may be required to play all their games away</li>
